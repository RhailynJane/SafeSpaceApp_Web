# Project: SafeSpace Admin Dashboard Development

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to develop the admin dashboard for the "SafeSpace" mental health support platform. The development will be done in a phased approach, with each feature being developed in a separate branch.

## 2. Development Plan & Branching Strategy

The admin dashboard will be composed of 7 tabs. Each tab will be developed in its own dedicated branch. This is to ensure that each feature is isolated and can be reviewed and merged independently.

The following branches will be created, each from the `main` branch. Each branch will only contain the implementation for its corresponding tab:

*   **`sam-admin-overview`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Overview" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-referral-intake`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Referral Intake" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-referral-tracking`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Referral Tracking" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-reports-analytics`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Reports & Analytics" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-system-monitoring`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "System Monitoring" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-audit-compliance`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Audit & Compliance" tab.
*   **`sam-admin-users`**: This branch will contain the implementation for the "Users" tab.

## 3. Current Status

*   The project is a Next.js application.
*   The basic project structure is in place.
*   A mock authentication system is implemented.
*   The branching strategy has been defined and documented in this file.

## 4. Next Steps

The next step is to create the 7 branches listed above. After the branches are created, development will begin on the first tab, "Overview", in the `sam-admin-overview` branch.
